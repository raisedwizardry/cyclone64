# Cyclone 64

Physics engine designed for the Retro 3D Game Development based on the  Physics code from Ian Millington's book Game Physics: Engine Development.

The first goal of this project will be providing physics functionality to a N64 homebrew game using the libdragon SDK, a project that supports N64 Homebrew development. Tiny3D, a project that provides 3D ucode for libdragon, wil be used to support the recreating the spirit of the samples in this project.

The initial tasks to accomplish this goal will be:
- ~~refactor the code to be organized~~
- compile the code using the libdragon toolchain
- recreate the samples using libdragon and Tiny3D.
